        A LaTeX document is usually based on a certain "document class", that determines the general layout and formatting of the document.
        In addition the use of several LaTeX packages may change various aspects of the LaTeX document.</paragraph>
        <paragraph role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">The result of a conversion into LaTeX will thus depend very much on which
        LaTeX packages are used and how much formatting it is desired to preserve.</paragraph>

        for international characters: If you for example use pdfTeX, searching in the final pdf document will only work for
        characters supported by the selected character encoding.
		Currently, Writer2LaTeX supports 8 different encodings which together are suitable for a large number of languages written
		with either latin, greek or cyrillic letters.</paragraph>

		<paragraph role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">Hard (or manual) page breaks are often used to optimize page breaks in the
		final editing of a document. In this case you will probably not want to export these page breaks, as LaTeX creates page
		breaks that are quite different from the page breaks in %PRODUCTNAME Writer. If you select this option, hard page breaks
		will be ignored when exporting the document.</paragraph>

		<paragraph role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">Empty paragraphs are sometimes used a simple means to create vertical spacing
		in %PRODUCTNAME Writer. In a well-structured document, an empty paragraph is probably a mistake. Hence you can select this
		option to ignore empty paragraphs in the document in the export. If you do not select the option, an empty paragraph is
		exported as vertical space.</paragraph>
