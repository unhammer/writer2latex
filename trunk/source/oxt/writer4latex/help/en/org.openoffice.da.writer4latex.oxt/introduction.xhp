        <paragraph role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">The purpose of the Writer4LaTeX extension is to turn Writer into a frontend for LaTeX.
        By installing Writer4LaTeX you will thus be available to author well-structured LaTeX documents using (almost) the full power of
        %PRODUCTNAME Writer.
		The functionality of %PRODUCTNAME Writer with Writer4LaTeX can be compared to the application

        		You can then invoke Writer4LaTeX to convert your document into LaTeX, process the LaTeX document and display the final result. You are free to create either  a LaTeX document that preserves as much of your formatting as possible – or create a clean LaTeX document that will resemble a LaTeX document created by hand.
