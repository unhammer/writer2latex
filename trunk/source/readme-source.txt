Please see the file COPYING.TXT for details.

Overview
--------

The source of Writer2LaTeX consists of three major parts:

* A general purpose java library for converting OpenDocument files into LaTeX,
  BibTeX, xhtml and xhtml+MathML
  This is to be found in the packages writer2latex.* and should only be used
  through the provided api writer2latex.api.*
* A command line utility writer2latex.Application
* A collection of components for OpenOffice.org
  These are to be found in the packages org.openoffice.da.comp.*
  
Currently parts of the source for Writer2LaTeX are somewhat messy and
undocumented. This situation is improving from time to time :-)

Third-party software
--------------------

Writer2LaTeX includes some classes from the OpenOffice.org project
* com.sun.star.lib.loader.* are part of the SDK for OOo
* writer2latex.xmerge.* contains some classes which are part of the xmerge
  project within OOo (some of the classes are slightly modified)
See copyright notices within the source files

Also, the windows DLL file unowinreg.dll is part of the SDK for OOo,
the source can be found at http://svn.services.openoffice.org/

Finally, writer2latex.util.Base64 is Harald Harders public domain Base64 class


Building Writer2LaTeX
---------------------

Writer2LaTeX uses Ant version 1.5 or later (http://ant.apache.org) to build.


Some java libraries from OOo are needed to build the filter part of Writer2LaTeX,
these are jurt.jar, unoil.jar, ridl.jar and juh.jar.

To make these files available for the compiler, edit the file build.xml in
the writer2latex09 directory as follows:

The lines
	<property name="OFFICE_HOME" location="/opt/openoffice.org/basis3.0" />
	<property name="URE_HOME" location="/opt/openoffice.org/ure" />
should be modified to point to your OOo installation

To build, open a command shell, navigate to the writer2latex09 directory and type

ant oxt

(this assumes, that ant is in your path; otherwise specifify the full path.)

In addition to oxt, the build file supports the following targets:
    all
        Build nearly everything
    compile
        Compile all file except the tests.        
    jar
        Create the standalone jar file.
    javadoc
        Create the javadoc documentation in target/javadoc.
    distro
	    Create distribution files 
    clean
